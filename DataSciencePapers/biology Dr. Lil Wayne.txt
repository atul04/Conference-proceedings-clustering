Title : The Nervous System

Author : Dr. Lil Wayne

Abstract : A research paper on the Nervous system. The Nervous SystemTo postulate as to the evolutionary history of the human nervous system in a term paper, one must look at how scientists have examined the neuronal organization of increasingly complex invertebrates and vertebrates. They can then speculate as to the methods by which complex nervous systems have evolved from simple ancestors. Until recently, speculation based on inferences was the only means by which scientists could trace the evolutionary history of the human nervous system.
