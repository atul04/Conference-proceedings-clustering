It can also occur in the nails and body folds.Psoriasis is not contagious and cannot be passed from person to person, but it can occur in members of the same family.Psoriasis usually begins in early adulthood or later in life. In most people, the rash is limited to a few patches of skin; in severe cases, it can cover large areas of the body. The rash can heal and come back again throughout a person's life.
