Title : Cardiovascular System

Author : Dr. Ariane Grande

Abstract : The cardiovascular system in human beings is a closed system; blood never leaves the network on it own accord. The human heart is comprised of four chambers: an atrium and ventricle for distributing and returning blood. Blood returns to the heart via the superior vena cava into the right atrium. Moves into the right ventricle before being pumped into the pulmonary artery into the lungs for re-oxygenation. Blood returns into the left atrium and then moves into the left ventricle before exiting the heart via the aorta to the rest of the body.
